upgradeable\r\n\r\n    * **Manage the Grunt build** that I wrote to build an optimized project artifact\r\n\r\n    * **Implemented a testing strategy** tied to the build process\r\n\r\n* **Built a

I designed and built a Gradle plugin for Oracle ATG E-commerce projects centered around mapping Gradle sub-projects to ATG modules. Performance  of the build reduced from a 10-45 minute execution time in Ant to 10 seconds-2 minutes in the rewrite.\r\n\r\n* **Bootstrapping AngularJS**. I wrote a proof-of-concept app on a modern JavaScript stack with Yeoman and centered around AngularJS. It demos unit testing Angular controllers and services, token based-authentication, and encapsulating heavy customizations to HTML via directives. This PoC effort started the conversation about whether AngularJS and the single-page app paradigm has a place as a standard technology.\r\n\r\n* **Managing the transition process from CVS to Git**, including documentation, a support team, and training for project teams. This was identified as a necessary but unwieldy obstacle that I signed up for.\r\n\r\n* **Bringing code reviews to the masses**.

A functional MVP, only missing recipe data, is complete.\r\n\r\n* **Built a single-page app with AngularJS/Bootstrap/PHP**: this lightweight product was for a customer to sell to realty service providers. Realtors gain access to videos of residential areas, accessed through the Vimeo API, for sharing with home-buyers. I worked on the AngularJS/Bootstrap front-end in a small team under contract. (3/13 - 2 months)\r\n\r\n* **Developed an apartment tenant-screening product** for a client to sell as a service. This Spring MVC app enabled leasing agents to run background checks on potential tenants.

My decision to manage pagination server-side turned out to be a crucial part of delivering an application with a comfortable user experience.\r\n\r\n    * **Developed a mechanism for automatically handling server-side Java bean validation (JSR-303) errors** by serializing error messages as JSON.\r\n\r\n   * **Wrote a DSL in Groovy** for generating code for a set of FAQ questions.\r\n\r\n   * **Designed and developed large portions of the core UI functionality**, a dynamic, search-driven table view. The table consisted of summary-level records that expanded to show other tables and more detailed information about the invoice, bill, etc.\r\n\r\n   * **Wrote a mechanism for exporting a .csv file of user search results**. This required logic for showing summary or detailed information, combining datatypes (e.g., export a detailed table of bills or a summary or detailed table of "records" to include bills, checks, etc.).\r\n\r\n   * **Challenged the team to modernize beyond Struts and server-managed views**. I directed and participated in scaffolding of the JQuery-driven AJAX client and Spring MVC, local MySQLand SOAP-client backend, to be built via Gradle.\r\n\r\n   * **Pushed for agile and a strong UI**. Short of an analyst or designer, we tackled UI wireframes, requirements scoping and continually revised estimates with planning poker. I managed user stories and technical tasks in JIRA with velocity tracking and oversaw daily per-commit code reviews.\r\n  * I made this a **unit-testing-first** project with JUnit, Mockito and PowerMock\r\n\r\n* Led application developers in building a customer loyalty account management website (3 separate retail programs). This was **an E-commerce framework Oracle ATG project** extension of the company\'s primary customer app (HEB.com). I developed user account management and program registration pages whose content was backed by customized ATG content repository templates. This involved configuring the ATG ORM and dependency-injection-managed service layer.\r\n\r\n* **Team lead for front-end components of a project archetype**. This was a short project to consolidate common preferences, architecture patterns, and standard technologies into a starter-project.
